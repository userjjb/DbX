Installation
============

This command should install :mod:`modepy`::

    pip install modepy

You may need to run this with :command:`sudo`.
If you don't already have `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_,
run this beforehand::

    curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
    python get-pip.py

For a more manual installation, download the source, unpack it,
and say::

    python setup.py install

In addition, you need to have :mod:`numpy` installed.
