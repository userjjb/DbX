	abstract = {For a finite but arbitrary precision, we construct efficient low separation rank representations for the Poisson kernel and for the projector on the divergence free functions in the dimension d=3. Our construction requires computing only one-dimensional integrals. We use scaling functions of multiwavelet bases, thus making these representations available for a variety of multiresolution algorithms. Besides having many applications, these two operators serve as examples of weakly singular and singular operators for which our approach is applicable. Our approach provides a practical implementation of separated representations of a class of weakly singular and singular operators in dimensions d⩾2.},

The underlying grid is locally refined using various levels of dyadically organised grids. The result of the convolution is approximated in the same kind of mesh. If f is given in tensor product form, the d-dimensional convolution can be reduced to one-dimensional convolutions. Although the details are given for the kernel 1/∥x∥,1/∥x∥,\{\{1 / {\textbackslash}left {\textbackslash}Vert x {\textbackslash}right{\textbackslash}Vert,\}\} the basis techniques can be generalised to homogeneous kernels, e.g., the fundamental solution const⋅∥x∥2−dconst⋅∥x∥2−d\{\{const{\textbackslash}cdot{\textbackslash}left{\textbackslash}Vert x{\textbackslash}right{\textbackslash}Vert {\textasciicircum}\{2-d\}\}\} of the d-dimensional Poisson equation.},

Basis functions introduced in the theory of approximate approximations are used. Results of numerical experiments, which show approximation order for the Newton potential in high dimensions, for example, for , are provided. The computation time scales linearly in the space dimension. New one-dimensional integral representations with separable integrands of the potentials of advection-diffusion and heat equations are obtained.},

A direct standard computation of the classical Newton potentials is possible but expensive. Here, a fast evaluation of the Newton potentials by using the fast multipole method is described and analyzed. In particular, an approximation by the fast multipole method is investigated and related error estimates are given. Furthermore, an indirect evaluation of the normal derivative of the Newton potential is presented. A numerical analysis is presented for all approaches mentioned above. Numerical results are presented for the Poisson equation and for the system of linear elastostatics.},
